\subsection{Branch and Bound}

\subsubsection{Description}

The branch and bound approach is a non-polynomial time algorithm which is guaranteed to return an optimal solution. The BnB algorithm at worst does not perform any better than a brute force search, but can have significant performance gains where portions of the search space can be pruned. This pruning is performed by iteratively defining sub-problems and determining lower bounds on the cost to go for these sub-problems. If the best possible cost for a sub-problem exceeds the current best cost that subproblem (and therefore all it's derivatives) can be pruned from the search space. The sub-problems presented in this algorithm are defined based on inclusion or exclusion of nodes from the cover set. 

\newpage
\subsubsection{Pseudo Code}

-\\

The overall branch and bound algorithm has the following structure:\\

\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{Branch and Bound}
	\SetAlgoLined
	\KwData{P}
	
	$F \leftarrow {(\emptyset,P)}$\;
	$B \leftarrow {(+\infty,(\emptyset,P))}$\;
	\While{F not empty}{
		choose $(X,Y)$ in F\;
		expand $(X,Y)$\;
		let $(x_1,y_1)$, $(x_2,y_2)$ be new configurations\;
		\ForEach{$(x_i,y_i)$}{
			\If{solution found}{
				\If{cost($x_i$) $<$ B}{
					$B \leftarrow ($cost$(x_i),(x_i,y_i))$\;
				}
			}
			\If{not dead end}{
				\If{lowerBound($x_i$) $<$ B}{
					$F \leftarrow F \cup {(x_i,y_i)}$\;
				}
			}
		}
	}
	
	return (B)
\end{algorithm}

where P is the graph, $x_i$ are all the vertices in the cover set, and $y_i$ are the vertices remaining for selection. There are four sub functions, "choose", "expand", "checkSolution", "checkDeadEnd", and "lowerBound". In the implementation presented here, choose selects the subproblem in F with the lowest lowerBound on cost to go. Expand takes that subproblem and returns two subproblems, one with the node with fewest unique edges selected and one without that node as a possible selection. checkSolution checks to see if all edges are covered by $x_i$. checkDeadEnd checks if $x_i \cup y_i$ covers all edges. Finally lowerBound runs the heuristic algorithm described in this report on $y_i$ then divides by the approximation ratio (2) to get a lower bound on the possible additional nodes required to cover all edges. This is then added to the number of nodes already in $x_i$.

\subsection{Construction Heuristic}

\subsubsection{Description}

The construction heuristic approach implemented here is the \textit{Greedy Independent Cover (GIC)} algorithm, presented in Halld\'{o}rsson and Radhakrishnan [1994] \cite{Hall97} for the independent set problem. This is an approximation approach which runs in polynomial time and yields an answer within a bound of the optimal solution. Runtime and Approximation Ratio analysis is provided in \ref{app_alg_analy}. This algorithm lends itself well to use with priority queues. All vertices in the graph are stored in a priority queue, ordered by the number of adjacent edges remaining in G: q[nodeLabel] = [nEdges,destinationNodes]. At each iteration the vertex with the fewest remaining edges is popped from the queue. Each of it's neighbors is then removed from the queue and added to the cover set. For each remaining edge in each neighbor, the source node is removed from the list of edges in the destination node and the number of edges in the destination node is lowered by one. This process continues until all edges are covered.

\subsubsection{Pseudo Code}

-\\

\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{Greedy Independent Cover (GIC)}
	\SetAlgoLined
	\KwData{G = (V,E)}
	C $\leftarrow$ $\emptyset$\;
	\While{$E \not= \emptyset$ }
	{
		select a vertex u of minimum degree\;
		C $\leftarrow$ C $\cup$ N(u)\;
		V $\leftarrow$ V - (N(u) $\cup$ {u})\;
	}
	\Return C\;
\end{algorithm}

Where N(u) is the neighborhood (all adjacent vertices to) u.\\

\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{Detailed Implementation}
	\SetAlgoLined
	\KwData{q,nEdges}
	C $\leftarrow$ 0\;
	\While{$C <$ nEdges }
	{
		u $\leftarrow$ q.peek()\;
		\ForEach{neigbor i in N(u)}{
			C $\leftarrow$ C + {q[i][0]}\;
			\ForEach{edge (i,j) in neighbor}{
				q[j][0] $\leftarrow$ q[j][0] - 1\;
				q[j][1] $\leftarrow$ q[j][1] - $\{i\}$\;
			}
		} 
		q = q - u\;
	}
	\Return C\;
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Algorithm Analysis}\label{app_alg_analy}

-\\

As discussed in Delbot and Laforest [2010] \cite{Fran10} the Greedy Independent Cover algorithm performs extremely well. As can be seen in table \ref{table:alg_perf} the relative error for GIC never exceeds 6\% (and this is on the Jazz graph where the estimated solution is only 1 node larger than the optimal solution). However, the disadvantage of GIC is that the worst case performance is relatively poor. As shown in Avis and Imamura [2007] \cite{Avis06}, the approximation ratio is at least $\frac{\sqrt{\Delta}}{2}$ where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree in G.

Figure \ref{fig:approx_comp} shows a comparison between the approximation ratios of several common algorithms described in \cite{Fran10}. Note that while GIC performs quite well, it's approximation ratio exceeds Depth First Search, or either of the Edge Deletion bounds for any $\Delta$ above 16.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{ApproxRatioComp.png}
	\caption{Comparison of approximation ratios between several Vertex Cover heuristics}
	\Description{Comparison of approximation ratios between several Vertex Cover heuristics}
	\label{fig:approx_comp}
\end{figure}



The time complexity of the GIC algorithm as implemented is $O(n^2)$ where n is the number of nodes. As each node is selected via the minimum cardinality, at worst it has zero neighbors, so there would be at worst $n$ node selections. However in this case there would be 0 edge updates. For every neighbor that is present there are edge updates equal to the neighbors' cardinality. This can be at most $n-i$, where $i$ is the number of previous node selections. The complete complexity is then $O(\frac{n}{2}(n+1))$.

\section{Conclusion}



\section{Math Equations}
You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are
discussed in the next sections.

\subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
in-text formula.  It is produced by the \textbf{math} environment,
which can be invoked with the usual
\texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end} construction or with
the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You can use any of the symbols
and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a few
examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
\begin{math}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
\textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just give a couple
of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\section{Figures}

The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or
more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown
in the example below.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
  \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \&
    Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia
    Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
  \Description{A woman and a girl in white dresses sit in an open car.}
\end{figure}

Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
the reader.

Figure captions are placed {\itshape below} the figure.

Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is purely
decorative. These descriptions convey what’s in the image to someone
who cannot see it. They are also used by search engine crawlers for
indexing images, and when images cannot be loaded.

A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than 2000
characters long (including spaces).  {\bfseries Figure descriptions
  should not repeat the figure caption – their purpose is to capture
  important information that is not already provided in the caption or
  the main text of the paper.} For figures that convey important and
complex new information, a short text description may not be
adequate. More complex alternative descriptions can be placed in an
appendix and referenced in a short figure description. For example,
provide a data table capturing the information in a bar chart, or a
structured list representing a graph.  For additional information
regarding how best to write figure descriptions and why doing this is
so important, please see
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/}.

\section{Citations and Bibliographies}

The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
--- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
(``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
article DOI, etc.

The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
  \bibliography{bibfile}
\end{verbatim}
where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.

Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of
ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the
``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this
command in the {\bfseries preamble} (before the command
``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source:
\begin{verbatim}
  \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
\end{verbatim}


  Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Fran10} \cite{Avis06} \cite{Hall97}

\section{Acknowledgments}

Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to
individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
document.

This section has a special environment:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{acks}
  ...
  \end{acks}
\end{verbatim}
so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected
during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
consistency in the spelling of the section heading.

Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered {\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.
